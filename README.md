## James B. Hunt Jr. Library Video Wall Templates and Documentation
### Link: https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/visualization_templates

As an NCSU Libraries Fellow, one of my primary responsibilities was to create templates and documentation to help lower the barrier of entry for content creation for the [high-definition video walls in the James B. Hunt Jr. Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/videowalls).

I gathered existing templates from several departments; created and organized a new repository for the templates on the Libraries' GitHub space; conducted a gap analysis of the templates and worked with a student designer to create new templates; updated documentation for the templates and made all of the documentation consistent; and investigated the appropriate licenses to use for the templates.

## NASA Dictionaries
### Link: https://github.com/nasa/dictionaries
In 2017, I was honored to be selected to be a member of the Fall 2017 [NASA Datanauts](https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/) class. One of the resources provided to us was a [repository](https://github.com/nasa/dictionaries) of NASA “dictionaries.” This repository was lacking contextual information. I took the initiative to research the provenance of the thesauri, taxonomies, and ontologies, and suggested additions to the documentation that were merged in May 2018.

## Collaborative Tools for Open Science

As an NCSU Libraries Fellow, I also contributed to various initiatives related to open science. I explored collaborative open science tools, researching the history and functionality of tools such as LaTeX and computational notebook environments, and summarized my findings for an academic librarian audience.
